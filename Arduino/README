For all programs with bigger code:
Make sure to disable UDP from uipethernet-conf.h  ! ! !
Otherwise the program gets too big :(

Aquarium_MQTT_PIR - test sketch with all aquarium functionality plus some logics for PIR room detection.
Aqiarium_MQTT_orig - the first version of the sketch - saved for looking back if needed
Aquarium_RELAYS - version with inverse logic (0 or low level activates the relays of chinese relay boards)
Aquarium_SSR - version with normal logic (1 or high level activates the SSRs of my board)
WeatherStation - sketch for the small weather station on my terrace (sensors - DS18B20, DHT22, BMP085)

Special thanks to Dimitar Valchev for making most of the soldering and giving me best advices for electrical part of the final product. :)
